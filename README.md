# facebook_bot_js
This bot is Facebook friend request remover bot which is written in JavaScript.
This is more like an automation and less than a bot. 

Steps to run this bot:
1. Open the target url. (for me it is facebook pending request page)
2. Right click and open Developer's menu.
3. Find out the className or tagName from developer's option.
4. Copy the code and paste it in console area.
5. Make changes according to yourself and run the script.

Note: To stop the script from executing just refresh the page. :p
